# Pyculator
Calculator made using Python.

Run to install Python on any Linux terminal (works on Termux too):
```
apt install python
```
Then, enter the command below to run the calculator:
```
cd Pyculator
python calc.py
```

(*Pretty useless program, was just made to entertain my boredom on a train ride.*)
